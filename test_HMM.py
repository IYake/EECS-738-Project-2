# 1) initialize A, B, and pi with random initial conditions, i.e., theta
# 2) forward procedure to find probability of seeing the sequence and being in state i and time t
#       - can also be used to predict next state, given sequence of observations
# 3) backward procedure to find probability of ending observation sequence given starting state i and time t
# 4) update transition and then emission matrices
#       - 4.1 calculate temporary variables lambda and epsilon
#       - 4.2 update pi, then transition matrix, then emission matrix
# 5) repeat 1-4 until desired level of convergence (using log likelihood function)
#       - also can test with diff number of states to see best convergence


# Example, checking if a chicken legs eggs that noon, every day
