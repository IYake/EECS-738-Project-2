# EECS-738-Project-2
Create a Hidden Markov Model to either generate new text from a text corpus or perform text prediction given a sequence of words. 
# Approach
For this project we used the Baum-Welch algorithm to train a Hidden Markov Model. Once the model was trained, we used the transition matrix
and the emission matrix to predict the next n number of words.
